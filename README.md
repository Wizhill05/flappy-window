# Flappy Window

Yo! So, like, this is a Flappy Bird clone. But instead of one window, it's, like, *multiple* windows. The bird's a window, the pipes are windows... it's windows all the way down, man. Trippy, right?

## Whaaat is it?

It's Flappy Bird. You know, that game that made everyone wanna throw their phones? Yeah, that one. But now it's on your desktop, and it's gonna make you wanna throw your whole computer. Probably.

## How to Get This Bad Boy Running

1.  **Get Python:** If you don't have it, go grab it. Google "python download." You got this.
2.  **Install the Stuff:** Open up your terminal or command prompt (that black box thingy) and type this:
    ```bash
    pip install Pillow wxPython playsound pyvolume pycaw comtypes
    ```
    If it yells at you, uh... Google the error? Or just, like, hope for the best.
3.  **Get the Bird Pic:** Make sure you have a `red.png` image in the same folder as `game.py`. It's the bird. No bird, no fly.
4.  **Run It:**
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```
    If it works, cool! If not, well, that's a bummer.

## How to Play (Spoiler: It's Hard)

*   Press **SPACEBAR** to make the bird flap.
*   Try not to hit the green pipe windows.
*   Try not to hit the top or bottom of the screen.
*   Basically, try not to die. Good luck with that.

## Why Tho?

'Cause why not? Seemed like a fun/dumb idea. Now you can experience the rage of Flappy Bird with, like, *way* more windows. You're welcome.

## Known "Features" (aka Bugs I'm Too Lazy to Fix)

*   It might be janky.
*   Performance? What's that?
*   If your screen resolution is weird, stuff might look... extra weird.
*   It uses a bunch of separate windows, so your taskbar might hate you.

Peace out!  शांति! ✌️
